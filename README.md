# Schoharie Democrats Logo
This repository contains a script for generating a (proposed) logo for the
Schoharie County Democratic Committee. It generates several versions of the
logo (in SVG and PNG formats):

1.  `schohariedems-hires.svg`: a high-resolution SVG suitable for any use.
2.  `schohariedems-lores.svg`: a low-resolution SVG suitable for use in
    situations where resolution and bandwidth are constrained.
3.  `schohariedems-*.png`: a PNG in various resolutions.

The logo consists of the silhouette of Schoharie County, in gnomonic projection
from the geographic centroid of the county, overlaid with the logo of the
Democratic Party (consisting of a "D" surrounded by a circle). Steps have been
taken to ensure that the files are reasonably small.
